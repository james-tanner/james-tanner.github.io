Hi! My name is James Tanner, and I'm a [British Academy](https://www.thebritishacademy.ac.uk/) postdoctoral fellow at the [University of Glasgow](https://www.gla.ac.uk/).

My research interests are concerned with how phonetic variation at multiple levels (e.g. across dialects, speakers, and languages) can uncover how phonetic and phonlogical systems are structured, and how this information can provide insight into speech processing (production and perception) and sound change. I also have a strong interest in quantitative methods and the statistical modelling of speech and language data, and particularly how we can use statistical models to better understand systems of linguistic variation.

I completed my PhD in the [Department of Linguistics](https://www.mcgill.ca/linguistics/) at McGill University, and previously developed speech synthesis software at [Resemble AI](https://www.resemble.ai/) and [Amazon](http://amazon.com/).

You can find my CV [here](/JamesTannerCV.pdf). Links to data and code used in my projects can be found on my [OSF profile](https://osf.io/53ew8/).
